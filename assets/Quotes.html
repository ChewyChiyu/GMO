                  Is it ethical for people to eat food that they do not know what it is fully. Is user knowledge important when it comes to food.

           <h2>  "Studies are also being done to test any longterm effects that GM foods will have on the body, but so far no studies have shown any negative results. Organizations are also concerned about GM plants cross-pollinating with non-GM plants". </h2>

            <li> Explanation 
                <ul> 
                  <li> 
                  GMOs are good as current studies show that there are no sign of long term negative effects. There are conserns though for the cross-polination with non-GM plants that may ruin biomes.

           <h2>  "While a 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine suggests there is scientific consensus that GM foods are safe, a majority of Americans perceive disagreement in the scientific community over whether or not GM foods are safe to eat." </h2>
           <ul>
            <li> Explanation 
                <ul> 
                  <li> 
                  Even though scientific evidence points towards the fact that GM foods are safe for human consumption, the majority of the population are still conflicted on whether or not this is really true.

           <h2>  "It is not possible to prove a food is safe, only to say that no hazard has been shown to exist. The fears of G.M.O.s are still theoretical, like the possibility that insertion of one or a few genes could have a negative impact on other desirable genes naturally present in the crop." </h2>

            <li> Explanation 
                <ul> 
                  <li> 
                  For GMOs to me 100% safe is impossible as there will always be the possibility that something can go wrong with the insersion of genes during the creation process that would potentially mess everything up.
