         <h1> Conclusion </h1>
           <ul>
            <li> With further research, we as a team believe in the use of GMOs. We found that GMO is very beneficial to our society for several reasons. For instance, there was a study done by Ohio State University showing that eighty to ninety percent of the food is genetically modified. We also came to the conclusion coming from a study done by Arizona State University that all four categories of  GMO are beneficial to the environment. With that being said, having GMOs will create less toxic chemicals in our environment. Another reason why we believe in the benefits of GMOs is that they give farmers a  more effective way of farming. In a study done by Harvard University, it is said that the growth of plant has increased from the original plant which was not genetically modified. Even with all our arguments, we can see that there are people that still think that GMO are bad for us. One of there reason is that GMOs bypass the FDA in an unchecked process, straight to the consumer. Even though it is true that we are unaware of the long-term effects of GMO, we do know that GMOs are safe enough to still eat. This has been tested by multiple studies at Harvard University. We also came up with the concept that without a GMO food source the world would face a critical food shortage. In conclusion, GMOs are good as they provide a stable food supply for the world's growing population.
