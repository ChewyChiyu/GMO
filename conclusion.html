         <h1> Conclusion </h1>
           <ul>
            <li> With further research, we as a team believed in GMO from the start of our project and still believe in the use of GMO´s. We found that GMO is very beneficial to society. For several reasons, for instance, there was a study done by Ohio State University showing that eighty to ninety percent of the food is genetically modified food. (Ohio) We also came to the conclusion coming from a study done by Arizona State University that the four categories of  GMO are more beneficial to the environment. With that being said having GMO will create less toxic chemicals in the environment. (Arizona) Another reason why we believe GMO is great is that GMO gives the farmerś a more effective way of farming. In a study down by Harvard University, it is said that the growth of plant increased from the original plant that has not been genetically modified.  (Harvard) With all of our arguments, there are people that still think that GMO is bad for us. One of there reason is that GMO does not go through the FDA in a fast process done by a study by the food safety board. Even though it is true that we are unaware of the long-term effects of GMO we do know that GMO is safe enough to still eat. This done by multiple studies by Harvard University.
