			   <h1> History</h1>
          <h2> Definition: GMO stands for genetically modified organisms which are created by splicing DNA from another organism and putting them into another organism to advance the growth of an organism. </h2>
           <div style = "display:flex; align-items: center;">
			        <ul>
  			        <li> The Flavr Savr tomato was the first organisms to be accepted by the FDA and sold on the market. </li>
  				      <li> Since the first approval of a GMO scientist has now engineered  Corn, Cotton, and soybeans as there top products on the market.  Which now takes up 80 to 95% of those crops are gentilic modified. </li>
  				      <li> Nowadays people call GMO with these different slang terms biotech food, GMO, Genetic engineered food. </li>
			        </ul>

         <h1> Process </h1>
          <img src = "assets/1.jpg">
            <h2>How it works</h2>
           <ul>
            <li> Two organisms are crossbred to create a new brand. </li>
            <li> They could be cross-pollinate. </li>
            <li> Using a gene gun were the gene that is needed is injected into the organism that needs the gene. </li>
           </ul>
          <h2> How it Made </h2>
            <ul>
              <li> Identify a trait in an organism that appeals towards the consumer preference. </li>
              <li> Isolate the trait and transfer it into a medium orgamism. One that will be the final stage product. </li>
              <li> Methods of transferring this trait include selective breeding, or manual insertion of genes. </li>
              <li> FDA defines GMO* through the process of genetic engineering ( meaning selective breeding does meet FDA standards for the tag). </li>
              <li> Insertion of genetic material is commonly done by cutting and pasting genes into a plasmid using enzymes and using a “gene gun” to shoot DNA metal particles. </li>
              <li> These growth of these mediums are carefully controlled in specialized growth chambers that are under constant moderation. </li>
              <li> A lot of the production cost of GMO* has to deal with the growth stage of the mediums, along with the reproduction of these mediums for more product. </li>
              <li> Automated machines are also used to keep track of plants and their optimal growth/spacing/nutritional requirements. </li>
            </ul>
